        Flour is perhaps the most important ingredient in a cake mix, as it creates the basic structure of the entire cake. A major component of flour is gluten, which is a protein that provides a way for the cake to bind to itself. 
        The gluten creates a web that traps and seals air bubbles into the cake mix. The more gluten that is formed in the mix, the tougher the cake will be. That is why it is usually better to have less gluten formation, so long as the cake sets properly. There are several different types of flour such as; all-purpose flour, cake flour, wheat flour, etc. The most common to use, and the one we recommend when baking a cake, is cake flour.
